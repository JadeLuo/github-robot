mergeRemovedComment: "I don't like to brag, but I just saved you from a horrible, slow and painful death by removing the `{{MERGE_LABEL}}` label. Probably. Maybe...
\nAnyway, here is why I did that:
\n{{PLACEHOLDER}}
\n
\nBut if you think that you know better than me, then please, go ahead and add the `{{OVERRIDE_LABEL}}` label. You'll be free to do whatever you want. Don't say that I didn't warn you."
